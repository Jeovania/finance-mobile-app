In this code challenge I've implemented the awesome "**_Finance - Mobile App_**" design from [Anastasia](https://dribbble.com/anastasia-tino) from Dribbble. 🎉

You can check the original design [HERE](https://dribbble.com/shots/10810913-Finance-Mobile-App) and other design from Anastasia on her dribbble account (https://dribbble.com/anastasia-tino) 👀

This is a simple, but beautifuly designed payment mobile app where you can manage your credit cards, your payments and even pay your friends. 🤜🤛
